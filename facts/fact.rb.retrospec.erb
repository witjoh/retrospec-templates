    # use the confine feature to lock a fact to only run under certain conditions
    # this is only example, so please remove if you want to run on more than linux

    # inspect the system for interesting data
    # when you need to shell out to run a os specific command
    # use the Facter::Core::Execution.exec method
    # Facter::Core::Execution.execute('/bin/uname --hardware-platform')
    # when the last method runs it should return a value to facter
    # so you don't need to manually use return value
    # below is facter 2.x method to return the result of a shell command, so you must run Facter 2+

### TIPS:
# Using other facts:
# distid = Facter.value(:lsbdistid)
